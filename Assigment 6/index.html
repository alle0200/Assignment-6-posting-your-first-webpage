  	 <h1>Terry the Tyrannosaurus</h1>

     <hr>

      <p>Once upon a time, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" target="blank">T-Rex</a> named Terry. <strong>Terry was a very cool T-Rex.</strong> Everyone could tell that Terry was cool because he wore a pair of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses" target="blank">sunglasses</a> everywhere. That's just what cool people do; they wear sunglasses all the time.</p>

      <p>One day, Terry ran into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_McQueen" target="blank">Lightning McQueen</a> on the side of the road. Lightning McQueen said hi to Terry, but Terry could not say hi back because he was a dinosaur (and everyone knows that dinosaurs can't talk). Lightning McQueen took great offense to this and started blowing things up.</p>

      <p>"You've yee'd your last haw, partner," Lightning McQueen grumbled as fire engulfed the vicinity.</p>

      <p>Terry would have responded to this, but he didn't because he was a dinosaur (and dinosaurs can't talk). Instead, Terry just stood in front of the explosions and looked really cool. The blasts swallowed Terry and Lightning McQueen whole, resulting in a firey death for both of them. <strong>There were no survivors</strong>, but at least Terry looked really cool for 5 seconds.</p>

      <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
